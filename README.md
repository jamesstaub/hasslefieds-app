# Project 2 Front End

This single page application uses jquery, handlebars and bootstrap to render JSON from the API. The user interface is extremely simple as the majority of my work went into the API.


## User stories

This app is a simple blog that supports users, posts and replies.

A user can create an account and login. Their session will be remembered for 1 day oruntil they close the browser.

A logged in user can create a new post and reply to existing posts.

A logged in user can delete only the posts and replies that they've created.

A user that is not logged in can view posts and replies but cannont create or delete them.
